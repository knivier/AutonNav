## Phase One BOM ONLY ($150 MAX)

---

## ðŸ”© **RC Car Phase One BOM (Remote Control, No Camera/Autonomy, just remote)**
Highway organizers: It is IMPOSSIBLE for $150 to get a fully auton RC car, I need that $350 to do that. I will build it so it can operate remotely for $150 and then I will need the additional $200 to get auton and docking systems running as planned
